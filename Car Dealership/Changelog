Okay, currently I have worked on options 1/2/3/5/6/7(Unlogged version).
Options 4 and 6(Logged in) still need to be finished and maybe additional options will be needed
for users to check their notifications when someone orders their car listed on the offers table
and maybe every user is gonna have a mailbox which will allow direct communication between users.
Also users will have control over their offers and they will be able to delist their offers and change
their status.

- Fixed offerpostings table and added a row 'offerPrice'. Now users can add a price for their offer or leave it blank which makes it display the following message in the offers table - 'Contact user for price details'.
- Created the functionality for 'Send special request' option. With that option users will be able to send special requests to the dealership.
- Minor fixes in output for the offers table, post a car offer functionality and my offers.
- Added notifications. When user orders a car, the seller will be notified.
- Mailsystem is currently work in progress.
